GistBlog
--------

My first attempt to learn Python resulted in a Gist Blog.

I had seen someone diong a similar thing, but wanted to learn more programming and how to use IO to files and connecting to APIs.

The program read markdown text from a file, "post.md" and posts the content from that file instead of asking for content. This way you can use markup in your blogspot on gist.

I will look at a better way of handeling different files etc later.
